This is the code that I used for my tutorial, *Getting Started With Flask*,
published on [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-flask-a-python-microframework).

It is a beginner tutorial that covers:

1. Installation of Flask and its prerequisites
2. Recommended file and directory structure for a Flask project
3. Configuration and initialization of a Flask app
4. Creating views and templates
